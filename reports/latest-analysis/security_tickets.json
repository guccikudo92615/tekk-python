    "description": "## Security Issue: Lack of Rate Limiting\n\n**Why this is a problem:** Without rate limiting, the application is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.\n\n**Evidence:** No rate limiting mechanism is implemented for the ChatMessageList component.\n\n**Location:** src/components/ui/chat-message-list.tsx:1-50\n\n**Why it should be fixed:** This is a Low severity issue with Low likelihood of exploitation. \nIt violates security standards: OWASP-ASVS V4.0, OWASP Top 10 A10, CWE-770.\n\n## LLM Fix Instruction\n\nCopy and paste this instruction to an LLM to get specific fix guidance:\n\n```\nYour task is to fix Lack of Rate Limiting in this Other application.\n\n**Problem:** Without rate limiting, the application is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.\n\n**Security Control:** RateLimiting\n\n**What you need to do:**\n1. Identify the specific code causing this issue\n2. Implement a secure solution following best practices\n3. Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n4. Add appropriate error handling and validation\n5. Test the implementation\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Follow OWASP security guidelines\n- Use secure coding practices\n- Provide working code examples\n- Explain the security improvement\n- Consider edge cases and error scenarios\n\nPlease provide a complete, production-ready solution with explanations.\n```\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Type:** MissingControl\n**Control:** RateLimiting\n**Category:** Other\n**Confidence:** Medium\n\n**Manual Fix Steps:**\n1. Implement rate limiting using middleware.\n2. Configure limits based on expected traffic.\n\n**Secure Example:**\n```\napp.use(rateLimit({ windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 100 }));\n```\n\n**Notes:** Consider using libraries like express-rate-limit to enforce rate limiting.",
